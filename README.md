### Findings on Testing Both Models
- Custom model is better at predicting images that we feed into, as jpg individually, it is also able to generalise more than the VGG16 pretrained model. VGG16 carries the baggage of pre-trained images, hence it can learn a particular class too well and is unable to generalise.
